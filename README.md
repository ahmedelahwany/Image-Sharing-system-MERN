# Image Sharing System using MERN

 ## an image sharing system which allows anonymous uploading, sharing and ranking images.

Uploaded images are sorted into Fresh and Hot categories.

Fresh images are the most recently uploaded.

Hot images got the most likes / up votes recently.

Up votes or likes are aging so old up votes are less important than the newer ones.

Anonymous users can like images ,but they cannot dislike them.
If an anonymous user liked an image, then he/she cannot like it again.
